# What's That Movie?

[What's That Movie](https://tianyizheng02.github.io/whats-that-movie/) is a basic web app that I created that retrieves info on movies using the [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/).

## Features

The web app provides the following info for each movie (if available):
- Title and Year
- Poster
- Release Date
- Runtime
- Genre(s)
- Director(s)
- Rating (Metascore)
- Short plot synopsis

## Credits

This web app was built on Kristen Koyanagi's [starter code](https://github.com/kristenkoyanagi/react-with-omdb) for Capital One's Software Engineering Summit coding challenge.
