# What's That Movie?

[What's that Movie](https://tianyizheng02.github.io/whats-that-movie/) is a basic web app that I created that retrieves info on movies using the [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/).

## Features

The web app provides the following info for each movie (if available):
- Title and Year
- Release Date
- Runtime
- Genre(s)
- Director(s)
- Short plot synopsis
